```lrc
[00:05.12] I can't get over you
[00:09.22] Can't get over you
[00:12.43] And before I die, I pray that
[00:16.61] I could be the one
[00:20.27] That I could be the one
[00:23.92] But I won't be no fun
[00:27.43] If I can't have you, no one can
[00:42.93] 
[00:33.23] Highlights, in the limelight
[00:36.78] Can you show me to the nightlife?
[00:40.46] Baby, I like more curves like
[00:43.99] But I want you, and I don't know right
[00:47.24] (Don't know right)
[00:56.24] 
[00:48.99] Tell me more, I got a box cutter with your name on it
[00:52.57] Tell me more, I can't stay this long on the same topic
[00:55.28] I don't know you, but would I fall in love with you?
[00:58.28] I don't have no social cues
[01:00.70] I'm out for you
[01:08.20] 
[01:04.13] I can't get over you
[01:08.37] Can't get over you
[01:11.76] And before I die, I pray that
[01:15.86] I could be the one
[01:19.32] That I could be the one
[01:23.04] But I won't be no fun
[01:26.52] If I can't have you, no one can
